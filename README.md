### Overview
This is a classic game of childhood favorite game, tic-tac-toe, with a spooky twist. Select your characters, fill in your names, and try to fill three tiles in a row without your opponent blocking you. The sidebar will let you know if you win, lose, or if there is a draw.

### Technologies
This project makes use of front-end development languages including:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript

### Libraries Used
* JQuery
* Animate CSS

## Media Query
This game should work best on most standard size mobiles, particularly for iPhones. 
This was achieved by creating a separate @media screen selector in the CSS file.

## Acknowledgments
Thank you Loden and Joel, margaritas on me.
